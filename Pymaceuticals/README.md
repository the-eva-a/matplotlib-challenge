# Pymaceuticals

## Project Overview
---
Pymaceuticals Inc. is conducting a study to test the effectiveness of various drug regimens on reducing tumor size in mice. This project involves analyzing the tumor volume data across different drug treatments to identify trends, outliers, and potentially effective therapies.

The primary goal is to investigate how different drugs impact tumor growth, identify outliers in tumor volume, and provide insights through visualizations like box plots and linear regression.
